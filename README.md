# AVLTree

## Overview
This program is an implementation of an AVL Tree, which is a self-balancing tree data structure.

It includes a test suite and can run in isolation in C++.

## Details
The user will either execute the program with an 
argument of how many items they want to insert into
a large-scale test tree with random data, or if no
argument is sent then the program will prompt the user
to input the number of elements to the console instead.

After inserting, the amount of time the operation took
will be printed in milliseconds. Afterward, the
program will execute a series of tests and output
whether they were successful or failed.

### Input
The program takes a command argument or otherwise
user input for the number of elements for the large-
scale timing test.

### Output
The program will prompt the user for an amount of elements
to perform the large-scale timing test with if not
given with a command argument. The program will then
output how long the insertion operation took in milliseconds
and output the results of subsequent tests on preset data.

## Installation
Open and run with Visual Studio 2022 (or your IDE of choice)
